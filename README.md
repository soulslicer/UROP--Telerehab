# UROP (Telerehab) #

## Overview ##

This was a research project I was involved with during the december break and part of my semester in NUS. It was actually part of an FYP but I was able to join as a Year 2 student as i could make some contributions.

### Telerehab ###

Basically, this project is an all-in-one system with hardware, software and a server backend that is used by therapists and patients. It allows a patient to conduct exercises in the comfort of his home, and the therapist is able to get the exact data and video of the patient doing the exercise. The iOS platform also allows for facetime which is useful

### Where can I get ###

Unfortunately, my contributions to this project end this december 2012, and the main project is in a private repo, but I have included part of my report to see the details of the project
